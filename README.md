# PyTorch Visual Attribution Methods on Cats vs. Dogs

A collection of visual attribution methods for model interpretability, in the case of the Cats vs. Dogs classification problem.

This project implemented GoogleNet using an old version of PyTorch; this doesn't work anymore
Thus, I need to use another neural network. I will use model finetuning in order to do that with the elephant.
