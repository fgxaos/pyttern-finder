# PyTorch Visual Attribution Methods on Cats vs. Dogs
*Inspired by https://github.com/yulongwang12/visual-attribution*

A collection of visual attribution methods for model interpretability, in the case of the Cats vs. Dogs classification problem.

## Motivation

## Workflow

### To Do: 
This project implemented GoogleNet using an old version of PyTorch; this doesn't work anymore
Thus, I need to use another neural network. I will use model finetuning in order to do that with the elephant.  

1 - Pre-train different models for the Cat vs Dog classification, using Kaggle data
2 - Once the models are pre-trained, add them to the method_models (main.py)
3 - Test with different explainers
